    <div id="addBox1"> How To Add Items To The Platform ?</div>
    <div id="addBox2">Capturing and uploading a photo of your product on ABC Retail is a simple process designed to make your shopping experience as seamless as possible. 
        Here’s a step-by-step guide to help you get started. First, take a clear, well-lit photo of the product using your smartphone or camera, ensuring that all important details are visible. 
        It’s best to capture the product from multiple angles to give a comprehensive view. Once you have your photos ready, log in to your ABC Retail account and navigate to the 
        product listing page where you’d like to upload your image. Click on the “Add Photo” button, which will prompt you to either drag and drop your images or browse your device 
        to select the photos you wish to upload. After selecting the image, you can preview it to ensure it’s the correct file. If everything looks good, click “Upload” to add the photo 
        to your product listing. The system will automatically adjust the image to fit the required dimensions, and you’ll receive a confirmation once the upload is successful. If you need 
        to make any changes, you can easily edit or delete the photo through your account. This process is designed to be user-friendly, making it easy for you to showcase your products in 
        the best possible light on ABC Retail.</div>
